Scattering Amplitudes in Quantum Field Theory

Abstract:  These lecture notes bridge a gap between introductory quantum field theory
(QFT) courses and state-of-the-art research in scattering amplitudes. They
cover the path from basic definitions of QFT to amplitudes relevant for
processes in the Standard Model of particle physics. The book begins with a
concise yet self-contained introduction into QFT, including perturbative
quantum gravity. It then presents modern methods for calculating scattering
amplitudes, focusing on tree-level amplitudes, loop-level integrands and
loop-integration techniques. These methods help reveal intriguing relations
between gauge and gravity amplitudes, and are of increasing importance for
obtaining high-precision predictions for collider experiments, such as those at
CERN's Large Hadron Collider, as well as for foundational mathematical physics
studies in QFT, including recent applications to gravitational wave physics.
These course-tested lecture notes include numerous exercises with detailed
solutions. Requiring only minimal knowledge of QFT, they are well-suited for
MSc and PhD students as a preparation for research projects in theoretical
particle physics. They can be used as a one-semester graduate level course, or
as a self-study guide for researchers interested in fundamental aspects of QFT.

Physics of the Analytic S-Matrix

Abstract:  You might've heard about various mathematical properties of scattering
amplitudes such as analyticity, sheets, branch cuts, discontinuities, etc. What
does it all mean? In these lectures, we'll take a guided tour through simple
scattering problems that will allow us to directly trace such properties back
to physics. We'll learn how different analytic features of the S-matrix are
really consequences of causality, locality of interactions, unitary
propagation, and so on.
These notes are based on a series of lectures given in Spring 2023 at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the Higgs Centre School of
Theoretical Physics in Edinburgh.

An introduction to the analysis of gradients systems

Abstract:  The present notes provide an extended version of a small lecture course given
at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin in the Winter Term 2022/23 (of 36
hours). The material starting in Section 5.4 was added afterwards. The aim of
these notes to give an introductory overview on the analytical approaches for
gradient-flow equations in Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, and metric spaces and
to show that on the first entry level these theories have a lot in common. The
theories and their specific setups are illustrated by suitable examples and
counterexamples.

Sep 5 - Sep 9.

Madelung transform and variational asymptotics in Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics

Abstract:  While Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) has been widely studied by
resorting to powerful methods in mathematical analysis, this paper presents a
geometric formulation in terms of Hamilton's variational principle and
Euler-Poincaré reduction by symmetry. Upon resorting to the Lagrangian
hydrodynamic paths made available by the Madelung transform, we show how BOMD
arises by applying asymptotic methods to the variational principles underlying
different continuum models and their particle closure schemes. In particular,
after focusing on the hydrodynamic form of the fully quantum dynamics, we show
how the recently proposed bohmion scheme leads to an alternative implementation
of BOMD. In addition, we extend our analysis to models of mixed
quantum-classical dynamics.

Introduction to Loop Quantum Gravity: Rovelli's lectures on LQG

Abstract:  These notes are a transcript of Carlo Rovelli's lectures on Loop Quantum
Gravity, given in Marseille in 2018, which (at present) can be entirely found
on YouTube. I transcribed them in LaTeX in early 2020 as an exercise to get
ready for my Ph.D. in LQG at Western University. This transcript is meant to be
a (hopefully helpful) integration for the video version. I reported the order
of the topics and the chronological structure exactly as presented by Rovelli
throughout the course, primarily to facilitate the comparison. Each Section
corresponds to a different Lecture. The parts written in textit are my
additions. Sometimes in the text, I report references, which specify precisely
the minute and the second of the corresponding video on YouTube, to very short
historical digressions or excursus made during the lectures by Rovelli that I
have not explicitly transcribed in these notes. Where appropriate, I took some
figures from the book "Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity - An elementary
introduction to Quantum Gravity and Spinfoam Theory" by Carlo Rovelli and
Francesca Vidotto, to which I always refer by the term "the book" in the
following. For what concerns the equations, where possible, I tried to write
down the "correct" versions present within the book. Finally, I thank Carlo
Rovelli himself for reviewing these notes. I apologize in advance for any
errors, and I wish everyone a lot of fun!

Beginners lectures on flux compactifications and related Swampland topics

Abstract:  These lecture notes provide a pedagogical introduction, with exercises, to
the techniques used in attempts to construct vacua with stabilised moduli in
string theory. The reader is only assumed to have a basic knowledge of general
relativity, geometry and field theory. We emphasize physical arguments and
focus on the latest developments involving the Swampland program that point to
a tension for the existence of AdS vacua with small extra dimensions or dS
vacua with parametric control. We include a brief summary of the current status
of these thorny issues. Unlike many other reviews we make almost no use of the
technicalities associated to supersymmetric geometries. These notes are largely
based on lectures given at the CERN Winter School on Supergravity, Strings and
Gauge Theory and in the Tehran School on Swampland Program held in the summer
of 2022.

TASI Lectures: (No) Global Symmetries to Axion Physics

Abstract:  These notes are an expanded version of lectures given at the 2022 TASI summer
school in Boulder, Colorado. One goal of these lecture notes is to (partially)
bridge the gap between what one learns in typical introductory quantum field
theory classes and what one needs to understand to follow modern developments
in particle theory beyond the Standard Model. Topics covered include global and
gauge symmetries, charge quantization, instantons, chiral anomalies, the Strong
CP problem, axion models from 4d and from higher dimensions, the expected
absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity, and some phenomenological
implications thereof. If these topics seem to be at best loosely related, I
hope that reading the notes will convince you otherwise. Recent developments in
quantum field theory have shown that ordinary gauge theories exhibit a much
wider range of (generalized) global symmetries than were previously understood,
while recent work in quantum gravity has provided sharper arguments that global
symmetries should not exist. This sets up an interesting tension, the
resolution of which can have implications for particle physics in the real
world. Axion physics is one setting in which these ideas can guide
phenomenology. The TASI audience comprised particle phenomenology students whom
I hoped to convince of the importance of learning more about quantum field
theory and quantum gravity. These notes may also be of interest to formal
theory readers seeking closer connections to real-world particle physics.

Scalar CFTs from structural phase transitions

Abstract:  We discuss scalar conformal field theories (CFTs) that can be realized in
structural phase transitions. The Landau condition and Lifshitz condition are
reviewed, which are necessary conditions for a structural phase transition to
be second order. We also review the perturbative analysis in $4-\epsilon$
expansion of the corresponding Landau actions, which were already analyzed
thoroughly in the 80s. By identifying the global symmetries of these fixed
points, it turns out that in perturbation theory only 6 different CFTs can be
realized by commensurate structural phase transitions. This is a lecture note
based on a series of talks given by the author. The goal of the lecture note is
to bridge the gap between condensed matter physicists and conformal field
theorists. The note will be further updated in the future.
