Scattering Amplitudes in Quantum Field Theory

Abstract:  These lecture notes bridge a gap between introductory quantum field theory
(QFT) courses and state-of-the-art research in scattering amplitudes. They
cover the path from basic definitions of QFT to amplitudes relevant for
processes in the Standard Model of particle physics. The book begins with a
concise yet self-contained introduction into QFT, including perturbative
quantum gravity. It then presents modern methods for calculating scattering
amplitudes, focusing on tree-level amplitudes, loop-level integrands and
loop-integration techniques. These methods help reveal intriguing relations
between gauge and gravity amplitudes, and are of increasing importance for
obtaining high-precision predictions for collider experiments, such as those at
CERN's Large Hadron Collider, as well as for foundational mathematical physics
studies in QFT, including recent applications to gravitational wave physics.
These course-tested lecture notes include numerous exercises with detailed
solutions. Requiring only minimal knowledge of QFT, they are well-suited for
MSc and PhD students as a preparation for research projects in theoretical
particle physics. They can be used as a one-semester graduate level course, or
as a self-study guide for researchers interested in fundamental aspects of QFT.
Supplementary material, Mathematica notebooks, corrections and further

Physics of the Analytic S-Matrix

Abstract:  You might've heard about various mathematical properties of scattering
amplitudes such as analyticity, sheets, branch cuts, discontinuities, etc. What
does it all mean? In these lectures, we'll take a guided tour through simple
scattering problems that will allow us to directly trace such properties back
to physics. We'll learn how different analytic features of the S-matrix are
really consequences of causality, locality of interactions, unitary
propagation, and so on.
These notes are based on a series of lectures given in Spring 2023 at the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and the Higgs Centre School of
Theoretical Physics in Edinburgh.

An introduction to the analysis of gradients systems

Abstract:  The present notes provide an extended version of a small lecture course given
at the Humboldt Universität zu Berlin in the Winter Term 2022/23 (of 36
hours). The material starting in Section 5.4 was added afterwards. The aim of
these notes to give an introductory overview on the analytical approaches for
gradient-flow equations in Hilbert spaces, Banach spaces, and metric spaces and
to show that on the first entry level these theories have a lot in common. The
theories and their specific setups are illustrated by suitable examples and
counterexamples.

Madelung transform and variational asymptotics in Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics

Abstract:  While Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) has been widely studied by
resorting to powerful methods in mathematical analysis, this paper presents a
geometric formulation in terms of Hamilton's variational principle and
Euler-Poincaré reduction by symmetry. Upon resorting to the Lagrangian
hydrodynamic paths made available by the Madelung transform, we show how BOMD
arises by applying asymptotic methods to the variational principles underlying
different continuum models and their particle closure schemes. In particular,
after focusing on the hydrodynamic form of the fully quantum dynamics, we show
how the recently proposed bohmion scheme leads to an on-the-fly implementation
of BOMD. In addition, we extend our analysis to models of mixed
quantum-classical dynamics.

Introduction to Loop Quantum Gravity: Rovelli's lectures on LQG

Abstract:  These notes are a transcript of Carlo Rovelli's lectures on Loop Quantum
Gravity, given in Marseille in 2018, which (at present) can be entirely found
on YouTube. I transcribed them in LaTeX in early 2020 as an exercise to get
ready for my Ph.D. in LQG at Western University. This transcript is meant to be
a (hopefully helpful) integration for the video version. I reported the order
of the topics and the chronological structure exactly as presented by Rovelli
throughout the course, primarily to facilitate the comparison. Each Section
corresponds to a different Lecture. The parts written in textit are my
additions. Sometimes in the text, I report references, which specify precisely
the minute and the second of the corresponding video on YouTube, to very short
historical digressions or excursus made during the lectures by Rovelli that I
have not explicitly transcribed in these notes. Where appropriate, I took some
figures from the book "Covariant Loop Quantum Gravity - An elementary
introduction to Quantum Gravity and Spinfoam Theory" by Carlo Rovelli and
Francesca Vidotto, to which I always refer by the term "the book" in the
following. For what concerns the equations, where possible, I tried to write
down the "correct" versions present within the book. Finally, I thank Carlo
Rovelli himself for reviewing these notes. I apologize in advance for any
errors, and I wish everyone a lot of fun!

Beginners lectures on flux compactifications and related Swampland topics

Abstract:  These lecture notes provide a pedagogical introduction, with exercises, to
the techniques used in attempts to construct vacua with stabilised moduli in
string theory. The reader is only assumed to have a basic knowledge of general
relativity, geometry and field theory. We emphasize physical arguments and
focus on the latest developments involving the Swampland program that point to
a tension for the existence of AdS vacua with small extra dimensions or dS
vacua with parametric control. We include a brief summary of the current status
of these thorny issues. Unlike many other reviews we make almost no use of the
technicalities associated to supersymmetric geometries. These notes are largely
based on lectures given at the CERN Winter School on Supergravity, Strings and
Gauge Theory and in the Tehran School on Swampland Program held in the summer
of 2022.

TASI Lectures: (No) Global Symmetries to Axion Physics

Abstract:  These notes are an expanded version of lectures given at the 2022 TASI summer
school in Boulder, Colorado. One goal of these lecture notes is to (partially)
bridge the gap between what one learns in typical introductory quantum field
theory classes and what one needs to understand to follow modern developments
in particle theory beyond the Standard Model. Topics covered include global and
gauge symmetries, charge quantization, instantons, chiral anomalies, the Strong
CP problem, axion models from 4d and from higher dimensions, the expected
absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity, and some phenomenological
implications thereof. If these topics seem to be at best loosely related, I
hope that reading the notes will convince you otherwise. Recent developments in
quantum field theory have shown that ordinary gauge theories exhibit a much
wider range of (generalized) global symmetries than were previously understood,
while recent work in quantum gravity has provided sharper arguments that global
symmetries should not exist. This sets up an interesting tension, the
resolution of which can have implications for particle physics in the real
world. Axion physics is one setting in which these ideas can guide
phenomenology. The TASI audience comprised particle phenomenology students whom
I hoped to convince of the importance of learning more about quantum field
theory and quantum gravity. These notes may also be of interest to formal
theory readers seeking closer connections to real-world particle physics.

Scalar CFTs from structural phase transitions

Abstract:  We discuss scalar conformal field theories (CFTs) that can be realized in
structural phase transitions. The Landau condition and Lifshitz condition are
reviewed, which are necessary conditions for a structural phase transition to
be second order. We also review the perturbative analysis in $4-\epsilon$
expansion of the corresponding Landau actions, which were already analyzed
thoroughly in the 80s. By identifying the global symmetries of these fixed
points, it turns out that in perturbation theory only 6 different CFTs can be
realized by commensurate structural phase transitions. This is a lecture note
based on a series of talks given by the author. The goal of the lecture note is
to bridge the gap between condensed matter physicists and conformal field
theorists. The note will be further updated in the future.

The physics of gravitational waves

Abstract:  These lecture notes collect the material that I have been using over the
years for various short courses on the physics of gravitational waves, first at
the Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris (France), and then at SISSA (Italy) and
various summer/winter schools. The level should be appropriate for PhD students
in physics or for MSc students that have taken a first course in general
relativity. The focus is on deriving results from first principles, rather than
on astrophysical applications.

Basic ZX-calculus for students and professionals

Abstract:  These are the lecture notes of guest lectures for Artur Ekert's course
Introduction to Quantum Information at the Mathematical Institute of Oxford
University, Hilary Term 2023. Some basic familiarity with Dirac notation is
assumed. For the readers of Quantum in Pictures (QiP) who have some basic
quantum background, these notes also constitute the shortest path to an
explanation of how what they learn in QIP relates to the traditional quantum
formalism.

TASI Lectures on the Particle Physics and Astrophysics of Dark Matter

Abstract:  These lecture notes on the particle physics and astrophysics of dark matter
(DM) were delivered at TASI 2022 ``Ten Years After the Higgs Discovery:
Particle Physics Now and Future." The focus of these lecture notes, aimed at
the level of advanced graduate students and beginning postdocs, is on indirect
(i.e., astrophysical and cosmological) probes of particle DM models. While DM
models and indirect detection are broadly discussed, the examples of weakly
interacting massive particles (WIMPs) and axions are worked out in detail. The
topics covered include: the role of DM in the cosmology and astrophysics of
structure formation, including DM density profiles in galaxies, general
constraints on particle DM models, the theory of minimal DM, with the higgsino
as a relevant and illustrative example, indirect detection with gamma-rays,
including with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array, axions as a solution to
the strong-CP problem and a DM candidate, including discussions of possible
ultraviolet completions and of axion string cosmology, and astrophysical probes
of axions such as with isocurvature perturbations, $N_{\rm eff}$, black hole
superradiance, radio telescopes, spectral modulations, stellar polarization,
and stellar cooling, amongst other topics. Example Jupyter notebooks are
provided that walk the reader through relevant analyses, including an example
statistical analysis of a DM annihilation search towards the Segue I dwarf
galaxy with gamma-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope that is relevant
for DM explanations of the Fermi Galactic Center Excess. We also provide an
introduction to frequentist statistics for particle and astro-particle physics.
These lecture notes are meant to be pedagogical, with the focus on explaining
the underlying physical principles and analysis techniques that are set to play
crucial roles in the search for particle DM in the coming decade.

Lagrangian trajectories and closure models in mixed quantum-classical dynamics

Abstract:  Mixed quantum-classical models have been proposed in several contexts to
overcome the computational challenges of fully quantum approaches. However,
current models typically suffer from long-standing consistency issues, and, in
some cases, invalidate Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Here, we present a
fully Hamiltonian theory of quantum-classical dynamics that appears to be the
first to ensure a series of consistency properties, beyond positivity of
quantum and classical densities. Based on Lagrangian phase-space paths, the
model possesses a quantum-classical Poincaré integral invariant as well as
infinite classes of Casimir functionals. We also exploit Lagrangian
trajectories to formulate a finite-dimensional closure scheme for numerical
implementations.

Representation theory in the construction of free quantum field

Abstract:  This is mainly a lecture note taken by myself following Weinberg's book, but
also contains some corrections to the abuse of mathematical treatment. This
article discusses projective unitary representations of Poincare group on the
single particle space, multi particle space also known as the Fock space,
creation and annilation operators, construction of free quantum fields and the
general relation between spin of state and spin of field. Both massive and
massless cases are considered. CPT is not considered. The first section briefly
reviews the basics of representation theory. This article further points out
some of the wrong treatment of mathematics in the book of Weinberg, and
reformulates them, including: Wigner's classification needs to be pass to the
universal cover via Bargmann's theorem, there is no projective representation
of Poincare group on Fock space in general, the Lorentz transformation of
fields need to be formulated with representations of the universal covers,
Dirac representation is not a linear representation of the Lorentz group. This
article also discusses the physical meaning of the state representation and its
relation with Schrodinger equation, compare its difference with state
representation, and the reason of equations of relativistic quantum mechanics
should be understood as a field equation rather than a wave function equation.
of equations of relativistic quantum mechanics should be understood as a field
equation rather than a wave function equation.



==================================================
Relativity

Abstract:  These lectures notes contain an introduction to General Relativity. They are
addressed to a general mathematical audience with no specific background in
physics. The goal is to motivate and explain Einstein's theory of gravity and
discuss some of the fundamental examples.

String Field Theory -- A Modern Introduction

Abstract:  This book provides an introduction to string field theory (SFT). String
theory is usually formulated in the worldsheet formalism, which describes a
single string (first-quantization). While this approach is intuitive and could
be pushed far due to the exceptional properties of two-dimensional theories, it
becomes cumbersome for some questions or even fails at a more fundamental
level. These motivations have led to the development of SFT, a description of
string theory using the field theory formalism (second-quantization). As a
field theory, SFT provides a rigorous and constructive formulation of string
theory.
The main objective is to construct the closed bosonic SFT and to explain how
to assess the consistency of string theory with it. The accent is put on
providing the reader with the foundations, conceptual understanding and
intuition of what SFT is. After reading this book, they should be able to study
the applications from the literature.
The book is organized in two parts. The first part reviews the topics of the
worldsheet theory that are necessary to build SFT (worldsheet path integral,
CFT and BRST quantization). The second part starts by introducing general
concepts of SFT from the BRST quantization. Then, it introduces off-shell
string amplitudes before providing a Feynman diagrams interpretation from which
the building blocks of SFT are extracted. After constructing the closed SFT, it
is used to outline the proofs of several important consistency properties, such
as background independence, unitarity and crossing symmetry. Finally, the
generalization to the superstring is also discussed.
This book grew up from lecture notes for a course given at the
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität LMU (winter semesters 2017-2018 and
2018-2019). The current document is the draft of the manuscript published by
Springer.
